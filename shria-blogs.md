Where did the obsession for commenting "first" on youtube channels come from? Is the competitiveness that stems from before our birth, where we competed with our siblings(?) to enter the egg? 

There's so many odd phenomenons that seem to spread like viruses, you could call them brain viruses. But calling it a virus does seem a tad bit unnecessarily negative. However it does take up unnecessary place in your brain. How much memory would it a concept such as commenting "first" on a youtube video take up in the 2.5 million petabyte memory of our memory drives? I'm guessing about 10 MBs, because the parameters it needs to know about are the concept of youtube and its comments section, and the brain is quite good at abstracting. 

If I sat and thought about every little thing we animals seem to do for no odd reason and try to justify it I might end up spending my whole life chasing an imaginary rabbit. Everything we do stems from something we did as children, and what happened to us through adults, and what happened to those adults when they were children, and what their adults did to them and so on and so forth. Contemplating such things could be a fun mental exercise but not worth spending more than an afternoon over (for me. I dont judge what drives others).

Im supposed to be writing unit tests for my project in my new job and I'm doing this. This does seem more enjoyable than creating test cases but why can't I choose what's more enjoyable to me. Perhaps I can change it but it will take some time to modify my brain. I'll make myself enjoy doing boring tasks and hate doing the things that will just waste my time with no purpose (those goddamned animes). Whatever. Yes there is no structure to these, it's my brain after all. Every thought's a rope and I'm tarzan-swinging through all of them super quick.
