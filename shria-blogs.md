Now that I am done with test cases I have moved on *(kinda been promoted i hope heh)* to a new thing. Its fun, challenging, vague but understandable enough to be kinda motivating. I should be doing that and i'm writing this now. Same old. When i was getting onboarded on they weren't kidding, saying that it would be an extremely steep learning curve, legit exponential curve (lmao) in my learning. There is so much i need to learn to get even close to what and who i want to be... god i hope to stay motivated for however long it takes to learn everything. Im aiming for a **turing award**. not kidding.

I have been happy these days, it feels like I dont have time to think about why I should be unhappy or time to find / create reasons to be unhappy. I guess this is why people who are constantly wokring seldom seem to have mental issues. they dont have time for those.

I have not been getting time to do much creatively , I'll have to manage my time a bit better to figure this out. I look forward to things. Ive also played some AOE for fun it is invigorating to say the least.

Euphoria is intoxicating

Okay I was wrong. Writing Test cases is actually pretty fun once you know how to do it. I was talking from ignorance of not knowing what exactly it entailed. I guess being bored by things actually is that, just plain ignorance from your part on knowing what it means. Once youre aware, everything becomes interesting.

I feel like i am on the right trajectory finally, after a long time. It feels i was just running around aimlessly like a headless chicken til I started working at my present company. I feel legitimately blessed now. The work is challenging and in the best way and I won't look back now. Everyone in my company is brilliant and it drives me to be better too, which is one of the best things one could go through.

I tested positive for covid, got the message yesterday night/today morning saying so. Im not sure if it is a kind of placebo but since I have got the positive result, I feel a lot sicker. My body hurts and I feel tired as hell. I'm hoping this is the omicron variant as it seems to be kinder on the host.

Thats it I guess.

Where did the obsession for commenting "first" on youtube channels come from? Is the competitiveness that stems from before our birth, where we competed with our siblings(?) to enter the egg? 

There's so many odd phenomenons that seem to spread like viruses, you could call them brain viruses. But calling it a virus does seem a tad bit unnecessarily negative. However it does take up unnecessary place in your brain. How much memory would it a concept such as commenting "first" on a youtube video take up in the 2.5 million petabyte memory of our memory drives? I'm guessing about 10 MBs, because the parameters it needs to know about are the concept of youtube and its comments section, and the brain is quite good at abstracting. 

If I sat and thought about every little thing we animals seem to do for no odd reason and try to justify it I might end up spending my whole life chasing an imaginary rabbit. Everything we do stems from something we did as children, and what happened to us through adults, and what happened to those adults when they were children, and what their adults did to them and so on and so forth. Contemplating such things could be a fun mental exercise but not worth spending more than an afternoon over (for me. I dont judge what drives others).

Im supposed to be writing unit tests for my project in my new job and I'm doing this. This does seem more enjoyable than creating test cases but why can't I choose what's more enjoyable to me. Perhaps I can change it but it will take some time to modify my brain. I'll make myself enjoy doing boring tasks and hate doing the things that will just waste my time with no purpose (those goddamned animes). Whatever. Yes there is no structure to these, it's my brain after all. Every thought's a rope and I'm tarzan-swinging through all of them super quick.
